WPS Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


WPS general presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for invoking geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, as a web service.

The WPS standard defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clientsâ€™ discovery of and binding to those processes.


NoiseModelling and WPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NoiseModelling v3.0.0 comes with 7 WPS blocks. WPS scripts for GeoServer are written in groovy language.

They are located in :literal:`Geoserver\\data_dir\\scripts\\wps directory`

.. tip::
    To know the functionality of each WPS block, wait a few moments with your mouse on the block, a tooltip text will appear.
